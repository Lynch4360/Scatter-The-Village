* As a first time user, I want to be able to use any device type and still use the website and play the game.
* As a first time user, I want clear instructions on how to play the game.
#### Returning user goals:
* As a returning user, I want to provide comments or feedback.
* As a returning user, I want to be able to access the social media links.

## Testing
### Functionality Testing
    I used Google Chrome developer tools throughout the development process for testing and solving problems with Padding, Margin and most Style issues.
    All links albeit the few that are on the site were tested multiple times during the development process to ensure that all pafges were linked correctly.
    Friends and family members also used the site once it was deployed and they gave feedback.
### Code Validation
    The W3C Markup Validator and W3C Validator services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.
### User Stories Testing
    New user: 
    As a first time user, I want to challenge my memory abilities.
    -Everytime the is reset the cards are in differant places making each game differant.
    As a first time user, I want to navigate the website easily.
    -The navigation bar allows the user to intuitively and easily move between the two pages
