* As a first time user, I want to be able to use any device type and still use the website and play the game.
* As a first time user, I want clear instructions on how to play the game.
#### Returning user goals:
* As a returning user, I want to provide comments or feedback.
* As a returning user, I want to be able to access the social media links.
